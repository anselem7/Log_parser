# Log_parser
## üìå Objectives

- Develop a Python script capable of parsing log files (e.g., system logs, Apache logs, or syslogs) to see if specific IP address appear.
- Identify key events such as potential threats(SQL injections, buffer overflow), errors, warnings, failed logins, or suspicious activity.
- Practice working with Linux environments by setting up and testing the parser inside an Ubuntu virtual machine.
- Gain hands-on experience in automation for log analysis and foundational cybersecurity monitoring skills.
<br><br>

## üõ†Ô∏èTools Used 

- Python 3 ‚Üí for writing the log parser.

- Ubuntu Virtual Machine ‚Üí to simulate a real server environment.

- Log Files (e.g., /var/log/syslog, Apache access logs).

- Regex (Regular Expressions) ‚Üí for filtering specific patterns from logs.

- Nano ‚Üí for script editing.

<br><br>

## Skills Learned

- Parsing and analyzing log data with Python.

- Using regular expressions to extract specific log events.

- Working in a Linux server environment (Ubuntu VM).

- Basic cybersecurity concepts like detecting failed logins or suspicious activity.

- Strengthening debugging and problem-solving skills when testing scripts.

## Steps Taken

<br><br>
### 1. Setup Environment

*Installed Ubuntu on a virtual machine(VirtualBox)*
<br><br>
- Ensured Python 3 and Apache were configured.
<br><br>
<br><br>

### 2. Log Collection

- Accessed web server logs (Apache/Nginx, if available) & Copied test logs for safe analysis.

*Access Apache access.log file and copied it to my_logs.log file*
<br><br>
<br><br>

### 3. Script Development

- Wrote a Python script that:
-  1. Opens the log file
   2. Gets user input
   3. Search & output the ip address in the log file

*Nano python script*
<br><br>

*Command line*
<br><br>
<br><br>

### 4. Testing & Debugging

- Configured the log parser to be python executable
- Ran the script against real Ubuntu access logs & Fixed parsing errors and refined regex patterns.

*Command line 2&3*
<br><br>
<br><br>

### 5. Detecting Security Threats 
- Extended the script to detect potential attacks

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project gave me practical exposure to log analysis, Python scripting, and Linux systems. By creating a log parser in a simulated Ubuntu environment, I built a foundation for cybersecurity monitoring and automation scripting. It also strengthened my ability to document, version control, and present technical work effectively for real-world applications.
